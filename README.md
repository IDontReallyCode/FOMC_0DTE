# FOMC_0DTE
Just an idea to look at 0DTE options around FOMC meetings

## Credit to KAMIKAZE for asking the question, JEC, and Blue for feedback

# Research Question
FOMC decisions are released at 1:00pm CENTRAL, with meeting at 1:30pm CENTRAL.
Is there a pattern in how 0 DTE options on SP500 index and ETFs behave?
